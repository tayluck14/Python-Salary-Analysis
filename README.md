This program was developed in spring of 2023. Since then the SimplyHired has updated their data scraping policies and implemented Cloudflare services to prevent web scraping, so the program is no longer functional. 
The program iterates though a list of free proxies until it finds a useable proxy network. 
Next the program would scrape revelant job information for the jobs listed on the site. 
Finally, the program creates a bar graph of jobs and the high estimate of their salaries.
